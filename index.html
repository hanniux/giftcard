    <h2>STEAM</h2>
    <p>While Steam is an online-only service, it still offers gift cards which can be bought in many stores. A physical gift card is a lovely addition to a traditional birthday or Christmas card â€” nicer than handwriting an activation code at the bottom. 
Steam also offers digital gift cards, so the process can be done entirely online.
The only real difference between a physical and digital gift card is the amount of money they come in. Physical cards are sold in amounts of $20, $30, $50, and $100, while digital cards can be worth $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.
A Steam card comes with an activation code, which can be used by the recipient to put the Steam card's value into their account's digital Steam Wallet. The Wallet balance can can then be used to buy games, downloadable content, and in-game items.
If you send a digital Steam card, the receiver will have the money added to their wallet by accepting the gift. If you've received a physical gift card, then you can activate it online by inputting the code.
