While Steam is an online-only service, it still offers gift cards which can be bought in many stores. A physical gift card is a lovely addition to a traditional birthday or Christmas card — nicer than handwriting an activation code at the bottom. 
Steam also offers digital gift cards, so the process can be done entirely online.
The only real difference between a physical and digital gift card is the amount of money they come in. Physical cards are sold in amounts of $20, $30, $50, and $100, while digital cards can be worth $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.
A Steam card comes with an activation code, which can be used by the recipient to put the Steam card's value into their account's digital Steam Wallet. The Wallet balance can can then be used to buy games, downloadable content, and in-game items.
If you send a digital Steam card, the receiver will have the money added to their wallet by accepting the gift. If you've received a physical gift card, then you can activate it online by inputting the code.

Smartphones and tablets are now being used for a lot more than just calling, texting and browsing the internet. Whether you are at home, on your daily commute to and from the office, or simply looking to pass the time, these handy mobile devices can now provide endless entertainment in the form of movies, TV shows, music, magazines, games, books and all kinds of apps.

Thanks to the digital media store Google Play, you can quickly and easily purchase these (or even get them for free) for your Android device. If you love feeding your hunger for books, watching movies starring your favorite actors, following episodes of the best TV series, or testing your gaming prowess in all the new games, then Google Play is our best source for your digital media needs.
Is it available where you are?

Since being launched in 2012, Google Play has presented more than 2.2 million published apps and enabled over 50 billion downloads worldwide. However, despite these impressive numbers, it does not necessarily mean that everyone in the world can access the same content.

Google Play customers in the United States, and certain other countries, have complete access to all of the store’s offerings. For others, however, some products may not be available, or only the free apps and games (and not the paid content) can be accessed.

If you have family or friends in countries where Google Play has only a limited reach, there’s a great gift idea for you. The next time a birthday or special occasion rolls around and the celebrant loves using their mobile device for entertainment purposes, send them Google Play gift cards that will give them unlimited access to all US content available in the store. How cool is that? Google play cards are also extremely easy to redeem.
